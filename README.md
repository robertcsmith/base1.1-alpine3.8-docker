## What is Alpine Linux?
Alpine Linux is a Linux distribution built around musl libc and BusyBox. The image is only 5 MB in size and has access to a package repository that is much more complete than other BusyBox based images. This makes Alpine Linux a great image base for utilities and even production applications. Read more about Alpine Linux here and you can see how their mantra fits in right at home with Docker images.

## What is MariaDB?
MariaDB Server is one of the most popular database servers in the world. Itâ€™s made by the original developers of MySQL and guaranteed to stay open source. Notable users include Wikipedia, WordPress.com and Google.

MariaDB turns data into structured information in a wide array of applications, ranging from banking to websites. It is an enhanced, drop-in replacement for MySQL. MariaDB is used because it is fast, scalable and robust, with a rich ecosystem of storage engines, plugins and many other tools make it very versatile for a wide variety of use cases.

MariaDB is developed as open source software and as a relational database it provides an SQL interface for accessing data. The latest versions of MariaDB also include GIS and JSON features.

## Features

  * Minimal size only 48 MB and only 4 layers
  * Memory usage is minimal on a simple install.
  * MariaDB the MySQL replacement


## Architectures

* ```:amd64```, ```:latest``` - 64 bit Intel/AMD (x86_64/amd64)

#### PLEASE CHECK TAGS BELOW FOR SUPPORTED ARCHITECTURES, THE ABOVE IS A LIST OF EXPLANATION

## Volume structure

* `/var/lib/mysql`: Database files
* `/var/lib/mysql/mysql-bin`: MariaDB logs


## Environment Variables:


### Main Mariadb parameters:
* `MYSQL_DATABASE`: specify the name of the database
* `MYSQL_USER`: specify the User for the database
* `MYSQL_PASSWORD`: specify the User password for the database
* `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`: specify the root password for Mariadb


## Creating an instance

```bash
docker run -it --name mysql -p 3306:3306 -v /var/lib/mysql:/var/lib/mysql -e MYSQL_DATABASE=wordpressdb -e MYSQL_USER=wordpressuser -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=hguyFt6S95dgfR4ryb -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=hguyFtgfR4r9R4r76 robertchristophersmith/alpine-mariadb

```

It will create a new db, and set mysql root password (default is RaNd0MpA$$W0Rd generated by pwgen) unless the data already exists.

## Docker Compose example:
####(Please pass your own credentials or let them be generated automatically, don't use these ones for production!!)

```yalm
mysql:
  image: robertchristophersmith/alpine-mariadb
  environment:
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: hguyFtgfR4r9R4r76
    MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpressdb
    MYSQL_USER: wordpressuser
    MYSQL_PASSWORD: hguyFt6S95dgfR4ryb
  expose:
    - "3306"
  volumes:
    - /data/example/mysql:/var/lib/mysql
  restart: always
```
